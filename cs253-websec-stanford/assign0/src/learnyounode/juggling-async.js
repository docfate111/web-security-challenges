// This problem is the same as the previous problem (HTTP COLLECT) in that  
//   you need to use http.get(). However, this time you will be provided with  
//   three URLs as the first three command-line arguments.  
   
//   You must collect the complete content provided to you by each of the URLs  
//   and print it to the console (stdout). You don't need to print out the  
//   length, just the data as a String; one line per URL. The catch is that you  
//   must print them out in the same order as the URLs are provided to you as  
//   command-line arguments.
